To build the server which will run on the NAO-roboter run 
> ./install.sh

This script does the following.

-Looks for the atom toolchain
-Looks for a correctly installed qibuild, which means the executable needs to be accessible via $PATH
-Creates a Makefile in the sourcedirectory ./remoteServer
-Initializes qi Working Tree
-Builds the server, which includes
	-a library "librm_manager.so" 
	-a executable "remoteServer"


To load these files onto the NAO switch to directory "remoteServer" and execute
> make scp
type in the password everytime you are asked

On the robot:
The uploaded files are:
-Executable: 	"rServer" in /home/nao
-Library: 	"RMlib/naoqi/librm_manager.so" in /home/nao

To make them autostart change the autoload.ini
-create an entry with the path to the executable under section [program]
-create an entry with the path to the lib under section [Dont know need to check next time]

To finaly use them make sure NAO is in a safe position and issue the command 
> nao restart
via ssh to the nao
